## AI Guardrails

Critical quality gates enforced throughout the lifecycle:

| Guardrail | Purpose | When Applied |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Code Quality** | Enforce standards | Pre-commit, CI/CD |
| **Security Scanning** | Identify vulnerabilities | Every commit |
| **Test Coverage** | Ensure quality | Pull request |
| **Performance Tests** | Prevent degradation | Pre-deployment |
| **Documentation** | Maintain clarity | With code changes |
