# Glossary

Key terms and definitions used throughout the AI-Native Software Development Lifecycle documentation.

## A

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**  
Lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project, including the context, decision, and consequences. ADRs provide a historical record of why certain technical choices were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind system design decisions.

**AI Guardrails**  
Automated quality checks that enforce AI-native development standards throughout the software development lifecycle. These include commit validation, security scanning, testing, and compliance checks.

**AI-Native SDLC**  
A software development lifecycle approach where AI tools are primary drivers rather than supplementary aids, integrated at every stage from planning to production monitoring.

## B

**BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)**  
A software development approach that encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical participants in a software project. It focuses on creating user stories with acceptance criteria that describe system behavior.

## C

**Closed-Loop Automation**  
A system where outputs are continuously monitored and fed back as inputs to improve future performance, creating a self-improving cycle.

**Context Window**  
The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that an AI model can process and understand at one time. Larger context windows allow AI to understand more code and documentation simultaneously.

## D

**DevSecOps**  
The practice of integrating security practices within the DevOps process, ensuring security is considered at every stage of the software development lifecycle.

## E

**Enterprise Governance**  
Comprehensive framework for managing AI tool adoption, data privacy, security, compliance, and risk in enterprise environments.

## H

**Human-in-the-Loop**  
An approach where human oversight and decision-making are integrated at critical points in an automated process, ensuring quality and catching issues that AI might miss.

## I

**INVEST Principles**  
Criteria for well-written user stories: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**  
A protocol that enables AI assistants to connect with external systems and tools through standardized integrations.

## P

**PRD (Product Requirements Document)**  
A document that clearly defines the purpose, features, functionality, and behavior of a product being developed.

## R

**ROI (Return on Investment)**  
A performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency and profitability of an investment, calculated as (gain from investment - cost of investment) / cost of investment.

**Runbook**  
A detailed set of standardized procedures and instructions for routine operational tasks, troubleshooting, and incident response. Runbooks ensure consistent execution of processes and enable team members to handle situations effectively, even when subject matter experts are unavailable.

## S

**SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**  
A testing methodology that analyzes source code to find security vulnerabilities without executing the program.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**  
A formal contract or commitment between a service provider and customer that defines the expected level of service, including metrics like uptime, response times, and resolution times. SLAs establish clear expectations and accountability for service delivery and often include penalties for non-compliance.

**SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**  
The process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software applications through various stages from initial concept to maintenance.

## T

**Technical Debt**  
The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

**Token**  
The basic unit of text that AI models process. In English, a token is roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words on average.

## V

**Velocity**  
A metric used in agile development to measure the amount of work a team completes during a sprint, typically measured in story points or features delivered.
