## Mission

The AI-Native SDLC project aims to provide comprehensive, practical guidance for organizations adopting AI-powered software development practices. We believe that AI is not just a tool, but a fundamental shift in how software is conceived, developed, and maintained.

## Why This Project?

As AI tools rapidly evolve, organizations struggle to:
- Compare and select appropriate tools
- Implement AI across their development lifecycle
- Maintain security and governance
- Measure ROI and justify investments
- Train teams effectively

This resource addresses these challenges with:
- **Unbiased comparisons** of 45+ AI coding assistants
- **Practical methodologies** tested in real projects
- **Enterprise-ready frameworks** for governance and security
- **Measurable outcomes** with clear ROI calculations

## Project Origins

This project emerged from hands-on experience implementing AI-native development practices across various organizations. The methodologies and recommendations are based on:

- Real-world implementations
- Extensive tool evaluations
- Community feedback
- Industry best practices

## Key Principles

### 1. **Vendor Neutral**
We maintain independence from tool vendors to provide unbiased comparisons and recommendations.

### 2. **Evidence-Based**
All claims are backed by data, real implementations, or documented sources.

### 3. **Practical Focus**
Theory is important, but we emphasize actionable guidance that teams can implement immediately.

### 4. **Continuous Evolution**
The AI landscape changes rapidly. This resource is continuously updated to reflect new tools and practices.
