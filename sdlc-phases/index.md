# AI-Native SDLC Phases

The AI-Native Software Development Lifecycle consists of five core phases, each leveraging AI to maximize efficiency, quality, and automation. This approach transforms traditional development practices by making AI the primary driver rather than a supplementary tool.

## Phase Overview

1. [Requirements Capture & Analysis](#phase-1-requirements-capture--analysis)
2. [Design Generation](#phase-15-design-generation)
3. [Story Creation & Task Breakdown](#phase-2-story-creation--task-breakdown)
4. [Development Planning & Implementation](#phase-3-development-planning--implementation)
5. [Quality Assurance & Deployment](#phase-4-quality-assurance--deployment)
6. [Production Monitoring & Continuous Improvement](#phase-5-production-monitoring--continuous-improvement)

---

## Phase 1: Requirements Capture & Analysis

### 1. Initial Planning Meeting (IPM) / Strategy Session
- Record session using AI-enabled transcription software
- Capture all stakeholder requirements, constraints, and objectives
- Document technical decisions and architectural considerations

### 2. AI-Powered Documentation Generation
- Feed transcription to AI development assistant (IDE-integrated or desktop)
- Generate initial PRD (Product Requirements Document) or appropriate documentation
- Prompt should explicitly request identification of gaps and ambiguities
- Include context about project type, technology stack, and constraints

### 3. Gap Analysis & Refinement
- Review AI-generated documentation with stakeholders
- Identify and fill gaps directly within the same AI assistant session
- Maintain conversation context for consistency
- Iterate until comprehensive coverage achieved

### 4. Final Documentation Export
- Generate polished version to documentation platform using AI assistant integrations

---

## Phase 1.5: Design Generation

### 1. AI-Powered Mock Creation
- Feed PRD and meeting transcripts to AI-enabled design software
- Generate visual mockups for major features
- Export designs as references for development team

### 2. Design Integration
- Attach design mocks to relevant project management tickets
- Use as visual reference during story creation
- Developers reference mocks during implementation (visual guide only, not code generation)

---

## Phase 2: Story Creation & Task Breakdown

### 1. BDD Story Generation
- AI development assistant using documentation platform integrations reads finalized documentation
- Creates epic(s) based on major features from PRD
- Generates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style user stories as sub-items of the epic(s)
- Creates comprehensive task breakdown including:
  - Feature stories with acceptance criteria
  - Technical tasks with implementation details
  - Bug tickets for known issues
  - Non-functional requirements (performance, security)

### 2. Story Review & Refinement
- Human review for business logic accuracy
- Ensure stories follow INVEST principles
- Add story points and priority rankings

### 3. Issue Management Integration
- Automated creation in project management platform via AI assistant integrations
- Proper labeling, components, and fix versions
- Link issues to epics and dependencies
- Set up automation rules for workflow transitions

---

## Phase 3: Development Planning & Implementation

### 1. AI-Powered Development Planning
- From IDE, use AI coding assistant to analyze project management issues
- Generate comprehensive implementation plans including:
  - Architecture decisions and patterns
  - File structure and module organization
  - API contracts and data models
  - Test strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Adherence to all AI Guardrails

### 2. Plan Review & Approval
- Human architect/lead reviews AI-generated plan
- Ensures alignment with system architecture
- Validates technical approach and estimates
- Approves or requests revisions

### 3. Implementation
- AI coding assistant implements approved plan
- Follows established patterns and conventions
- Generates tests alongside implementation
- Creates comprehensive documentation

---

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Deployment

### 1. Version Control & Review Process
- Commit with AI-generated commit messages
- Create pull request with detailed description
- Automated PR checks trigger (see [AI Guardrails](/guardrails/))

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Guardrails
All quality checks are automatically executed as defined in the AI Guardrails. The pipeline includes:
- **Pre-merge Checks**: Code quality, security, and test validation
- **AI Code Review**: AI-powered automated suggestions and analysis
- **Human Review**: Final approval with business logic verification

### 3. Release & Deployment Pipeline
- **Post-merge Actions**:
  - Automated versioning and changelog generation
  - Create version control platform release with notes
  - Update project management issue statuses
  - Trigger deployment pipeline
- **Deployment Stages**:
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Run smoke tests
  - Execute load testing suite (for staging)
  - Deploy to production (upon approval)
- **Error Handling**:
  - CI/CD failures automatically create error monitoring issues
  - Issues linked back to original project management tickets
  - Notifications sent to relevant channels

---

## Phase 5: Production Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

### 1. Observability & Monitoring
- **Automated Issue Creation with Error Monitoring**:
  - Errors create project management issues
  - Performance degradation create project management issues
  - Issues include full context and stack traces

### 2. AI-Powered Incident Resolution
- AI coding assistant analyzes error monitoring issues
- Automatically creates PR with suggested fixes
- Includes root cause analysis
- References similar past incidents

### 3. Continuous Deployment Loop
- Fix PRs go through standard CI/CD pipeline
- Human reviews and approves AI fixes
- Automated deployment upon approval
- Monitors fix effectiveness

---

## Integration Architecture

### Notification & Communication Triggers

1. **Project Management → Team Communication Integrations**
   - Issue creation/update notifications
   - Release notifications with changelog

2. **Version Control → Team Communication Integrations**
   - PR creation and review requests
   - PR approval and merge notifications
   - Release creation announcements
   - Build failure alerts

3. **Project Management Release Automations**
   - Webhook triggers bulk issue status updates
   - AI uses Changelog to generate release announcement in documentation platform
