# Enterprise Governance & Risk Management

This comprehensive governance framework addresses the unique challenges of AI-native software development, ensuring security, compliance, and risk management while enabling innovation and productivity gains.

## Governance Model

### AI Tool Approval Framework

**Executive Sponsor**: Designated C-level or VP sponsor for AI initiative approval and budget allocation

**AI Steering Committee**: Cross-functional team including IT Security, Legal, Compliance, and Engineering leadership

**Tool Evaluation Process**: 
- Security assessment and vendor due diligence
- Data handling and privacy impact analysis
- ROI and business case validation
- Pilot program approval and success criteria definition

### Prompt Management & Review

**Prompt Library Governance**: All development prompts stored in version-controlled repositories with approval workflow

**Review Process**: Technical and business stakeholders review prompts for:
- Security implications and data exposure risks
- Business logic accuracy and compliance requirements
- Quality standards and consistency with organizational guidelines

**Approval Hierarchy**: 
- Standard development prompts: Team lead approval via pull request
- Cross-functional prompts: Department head approval via documentation review
- Client data prompts: Security and legal team approval via formal review process

**Audit Trail**: All prompt changes logged through version control with reviewer signatures and rationale

### Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Authority Level | Requirements |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Day-to-day AI usage** | Individual developers | Within approved guardrails |
| **New AI tool adoption** | Department head | IT Security sign-off required |
| **Client data processing** | Legal and compliance team | Formal approval process |
| **Enterprise-wide AI policy changes** | AI Steering Committee | Executive approval |

## Data Privacy & Security

### Data Classification Framework

| Classification | Description | AI Processing Guidelines |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Public Data** | Open-source code, public documentation, general patterns | Freely processable by AI tools |
| **Internal Data** | Coding standards, architecture patterns, technical docs | Requires access controls |
| **Confidential Data** | Proprietary algorithms, client business logic, architectures | Limited AI processing with safeguards |
| **Restricted Data** | Security configs, API keys, client implementations | Prohibited from AI processing |

### AI Development Tool Data Handling Policies

**Data Minimization**: Only send code context necessary for specific development assistance tasks

**Data Anonymization**: Remove or mask client identifiers, API keys, and sensitive business logic before AI processing

**Retention Policies**: AI vendors must delete development data within specified timeframes (typically 30 days)

**Geographic Restrictions**: Code processing must occur within approved geographic boundaries

**Vendor Agreements**: All AI development tool vendors must sign data processing agreements (DPAs) with specific security and privacy requirements

### Client Code Protection Measures

- **Explicit Consent**: Written approval required before processing any client-specific code through AI development tools
- **Code Mapping**: Comprehensive inventory of what client code is processed by which AI development tools
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to AI tools with client code capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Automated detection of unauthorized code sharing with AI development tools
- **Incident Response**: Defined procedures for potential client code exposure through AI development tools

### Technical Safeguards

- **Network Isolation**: AI development tool access through secure, monitored network segments
- **Encryption**: All code and development data encrypted in transit and at rest when processed by AI tools
- **API Key Management**: Centralized management of AI development tool credentials with regular rotation
- **Session Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of AI development tool interactions with alerting on suspicious activity

## Change Management & Transition Planning

### Phased Adoption Strategy

| Phase | Timeline | Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1 - Pilot Program** | Months 1-3 | Select 1-2 low-risk projects with willing early adopters | 80% developer satisfaction, 30% productivity gain |
| **Phase 2 - Department Rollout** | Months 4-8 | Expand to full development team with lessons learned | 50% adoption rate, measurable quality improvements |
| **Phase 3 - Enterprise Scaling** | Months 9-12 | Roll out to multiple departments and projects | 80% adoption, positive ROI demonstrated |

### AI Development Training

**Developer Training**: 
- AI development tool usage
- Prompt engineering for coding assistance
- Security best practices
- Hands-on workshops and labs

**Management Training**: 
- Executive briefings on AI development capabilities
- Risk awareness and mitigation strategies
- Governance requirements understanding
- ROI measurement and reporting

### Success Criteria & KPIs

- **Productivity Metrics**: 30% reduction in development time, 50% reduction in bug fix time
- **Quality Metrics**: 40% reduction in post-deployment defects
- **Risk Metrics**: Zero security incidents, 99.9% AI tool uptime
- **Adoption Metrics**: 80% developer adoption, 90% satisfaction rate

## Compliance & Audit Trail

### Audit Logging Requirements

**AI Tool Interactions**: Every AI development assistance query, response, and action logged with timestamps and user identification

**Code Generation Tracking**: AI-generated code marked with metadata including:
- AI tool used and version
- Development prompt used for generation
- Human reviewer and approval
- Business context and requirements

**Decision Tracking**: All AI-influenced development decisions logged with rationale and human oversight details

**Data Access Logging**: Comprehensive logs of what project data was accessed by AI tools when and by whom

### Compliance Framework Integration

- **SOC 2 Type II**: AI development tool usage integrated into existing SOC 2 controls and audit procedures
- **ISO 27001**: AI development security controls mapped to ISO 27001 framework requirements
- **Industry Regulations**: Compliance with relevant regulations as applicable to development practices and client requirements
- **Internal Audits**: Quarterly internal audits of AI development tool usage, governance compliance, and security controls
