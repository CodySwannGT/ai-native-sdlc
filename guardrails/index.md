# AI Guardrails

AI Guardrails are automated quality checks that enforce AI-native development standards throughout the software development lifecycle. These guardrails ensure code quality, security, and consistency while enabling rapid development with AI assistance.

## Overview

The guardrails system provides comprehensive automated validation at multiple stages:
- **Commit Hooks**: Fast local validation before code reaches the repository
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive validation during the build process
- **Post-Deployment**: Monitoring and validation in production environments

## Guardrails Reference Table

| **dependency_vulnerability_scan** | 🛡️ Dependency vulnerability scanning | CI/CD |
| **secret_scanning** | 🔐 Detects hardcoded secrets and credentials | CI/CD |
| **license_compliance** | 📜 Validates open source license compliance | CI/CD |
| **code_quality_check** | 🤖 AI-powered code quality review | CI/CD |
| **claude_security_scan** | 🛡️ AI-powered security vulnerability detection | CI/CD |
| **compliance_validation** | ✅ Validates compliance framework requirements | CI/CD |

## Implementation Guide

### Commit Hook Guardrails

Commit hooks provide fast, local validation to catch issues before they reach the repository:

```yaml
# Example commit hook configuration
hooks:
  pre-commit:
    - commit_message_validation
    - typecheck
    - test_unit
    - format
    - build
```

**Benefits:**
- Immediate feedback during development
- Reduces CI/CD pipeline failures
- Enforces standards at the source

### CI/CD Pipeline Guardrails

The CI/CD pipeline runs comprehensive validation:

```yaml
# Example CI/CD pipeline stages
stages:
  - validation:
      - commit_message_validation
      - pr_message_validation
      - lint
      - format
  
  - security:
      - dependency_security_scan
      - static_security_testing
      - secret_scanning
      - claude_security_scan
  
  - testing:
      - test
      - test_integration
      - test_e2e
      - visual_regression_test
  
  - quality:
      - code_quality_check
      - license_compliance
      - compliance_validation
  
  - build:
      - build
      - infrastructure_validation
  
  - post-deploy:
      - smoke_test
      - load_testing
      - chaos_engineering
```

### Project-Specific Configuration

Different project types require different guardrails:

#### Mobile Projects
- Browser automation for mobile web testing
- Mobile-specific UI component linting
- Platform-specific build validation
- App store compliance checks

#### Infrastructure Projects
- Infrastructure-as-Code validation
- Terraform/CloudFormation linting
- Cost estimation
- Security policy validation

#### Web Projects
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance budgets
- Accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- SEO validation

#### API Projects
- Contract testing
- API documentation validation
- Rate limiting tests
- Security header validation

## Best Practices

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Start with essential guardrails and add more as the team matures:
- **Phase 1**: Basic linting, unit tests, build validation
- **Phase 2**: Security scanning, integration tests
- **Phase 3**: Performance testing, chaos engineering
- **Phase 4**: AI-powered analysis, compliance validation

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Run expensive checks in parallel
- Use caching for dependency scanning
- Implement incremental testing for large codebases
- Set appropriate timeouts for each check

### 3. Clear Feedback
- Provide actionable error messages
- Include fix suggestions in failure reports
- Link to documentation for complex issues
- Use visual indicators in PR comments

### 4. Continuous Improvement
- Monitor guardrail effectiveness metrics
- Regular review of false positives
- Update rules based on new security threats
- Incorporate team feedback

## Metrics and Monitoring

Track guardrail effectiveness with these key metrics:

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **First-time Pass Rate** | >85% | Indicates developer understanding of standards |
| **Mean Time to Fix** | <30 min | Shows how quickly issues are resolved |
| **False Positive Rate** | <5% | Ensures guardrails remain helpful, not hindering |
| **Security Issue Detection** | >95% | Validates security scanning effectiveness |
| **Performance Regression Detection** | >90% | Ensures performance standards are maintained |

## Integration with AI Development

### AI-Specific Validations
- Verify AI-generated code includes proper attribution
- Check for AI-specific security patterns
- Validate prompt injection prevention
- Ensure AI context limits are respected

### Continuous Learning
- Feed guardrail results back to AI assistants
- Update AI prompts based on common failures
- Train custom models on guardrail patterns
- Share learnings across projects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Guardrail timeouts** | Increase timeout limits or optimize check performance |
| **Flaky tests** | Implement retry logic and improve test stability |
| **High false positive rate** | Review and tune detection rules |
| **Slow feedback loops** | Parallelize checks and implement caching |
| **Integration conflicts** | Ensure proper tool versioning and compatibility |
